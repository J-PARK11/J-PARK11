### üå± Introduce
Hi, This is Junhyeok Park, I work at the Hanyang Graduate School Machine Learning Lab.    
I am interested in multimodal large language models and complex video understanding.          
I am in a KT Master's Course funded by KT Corporation.       
If you have any questions or want to know more about my career, project or collaboration, please contact me through e-mail or sns.
