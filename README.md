### üå± Introduce
Hi, my name is Junhyeok Park, and I work at the Hanyang Graduate School Machine Learning Lab.    
I am interested in multimodal large language models and video understanding.
And I am in a KT Master's Course funded by KT Corporation.
If you have any questions about project or collaboration, please contact me through SNS.      

### üí° Major Interest
- Multimodal Large Language Model : Handling multimodal large language models and using this to solve any challenging and algorithmic problem.
- Video Understanding : Represent a more powerful feature for long-sequence video understanding.
- Outlier Detection : Multi-Domain Outlier Detection Framework based on Deep Neural Network
